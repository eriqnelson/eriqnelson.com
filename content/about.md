Thanks for exploring my website. This is where I experiment, play, and explore new concepts in software engineering. I’m a software developer with a focus on operations. DevOps is my passion because it focuses on communication and collaboration.

Every project is different, and my unique skill set allows me to help you with whatever kindles your imagination. It’s not just about code, after all: it’s about making something that’s unique, meaningful, and functional. My background is in supply chain management, business process automation, design, and accounting. That means that, in addition to designing and building tools that will work for you, I excel at project management. I already understand how businesses operate, and people too: don’t worry, I speak human!

I like conversations about philosophy, engineering, design, psychology and technology.

I am available for hire at your company right now. If you have something specific in mind, please contact me. I’m always looking for new ideas and I love talking tech.

Here’s my [contact information](/#contact). I hope to hear from you soon.
