I’ve spent a hilarious number of hours in Minecraft doing any number of things from simple mining to building enormous factories that cause even the mightiest of servers to creak under the load of them.

Really though, it’s made me deeply appreciate magical flowers.

## The Game
If you haven’t played Minecraft and aren’t familiar with the basic concept, [here’s a really well written overview of what the game is](http://minemum.com/what-is-minecraft). At it’s heart it’s a sandbox to play in. Personally I like taking on engineering and resource management challenges and automating large machines.

## The Mods
There are many mods available that are loaded onto the basic Minecraft game that add new mechanics, new blocks, abilities or fundamentally change the way the game is played. The two that I’ll be talking about today are Open Computers and Botania

### [Open Computers](http://ocdoc.cil.li/)

>OpenComputers is a mod that adds computers and robots into the game, which can be programmed in Lua 5.3. It takes ideas from a couple of other mods such as ComputerCraft, StevesCarts and Modular Powersuits to create something new and interesting.

### [Botania](http://botaniamod.net/)

>Botania is a tech mod themed around natural magic. The main concept is to create magical flowers and devices utilizing the power of the earth, in the form of Mana.

## Interface is a visual language

Botania and Open Computers are not attempts at feature replication. Instead they are distinct approaches to a similar set of problems that a Minecraft player may encounter. I don’t think one is superior in some absolute, objective way.

Instead I believe that Botania represents better design. Mana (The primary form of magical energy used in Botania) is a new resource that feels like an extension of the game. The movement through space and time remains important. Your skillfulness at navigating terrain, building new structures, gathering resources and manipulating the environment remain the primary methods used to achieve your goals. It builds on you as a user and keeps the you grounded in a progression towards greater goals and powers.

From the Botania design guidelines it’s clear that it’s not accidental.

Botania follows some design rules...
* No pipes, wires or equivalent, they are boring and overdone;
* Abstain from using GUIs in favour of in-world interaction;
* Refrain from showing numbers to the player to minimize the incentive to minmax;
* Provide pleasing visuals utilizing only two different particle effects;
* Utilize or provide renewable resources where possible.

That extension of the Botania controls and resources into the broader Minecraft play environment makes it easier to design, test and execute many of its functions while keeping the player within the same context that they’re already fluent in. I don’t consider that fluency trivial. If you’re cracking open the Lexica Botania for the first time you’ve already mastered most of the basic commands you’ll need to use the mod.

In contrast the interface paradigm of Open Computers is closer in execution to the experience many of us have at the terminal level. It is a design that offers a great deal of flexibility at the cost of ease of use but  It isn’t necessarily a more useful tool. For the uninitiated a blinking cursor on a black screen is an opaque and seemingly hostile interface method. For the initiated it can be an invitation to great power. Still, using this mod is a fundamental break in your conception of space, gameplay and if you’re not already comfortable with a scripting language;  a major break in your fluency. Instead of being an augmented player with new powers and a grasp of some new mechanics you are player in the grips of readmes and mysterious runtime errors.

While you might think that an automation and engineering inclined person such as myself may take more readily to Open Computers it’s Botania that I prefer to reach for. Botania is a new set of words that I can use in my problem solving and Open Computers is an entirely different language.

## Language is a shared experience

I believe that breaking a user’s paradigm is an expensive moment. The competency that they’ve been developing is broken and they feel like a beginner once again. Once a user has developed fluency in the basics of an interface we have a language in common to expand on. Do so. When other developers start to extend your interface they should have guidelines provided to them that explain the design language clearly and show how it can be extended.

When I’m thinking about user interfaces, I want to try and bring magical flowers to the user. I think this extends beyond visual interfaces and into the design of APIs, data structures, code and essentially anything that a person will put their brain in front of. These are all interfaces and they should be beautiful. Not because beauty has a separate merit but rather that a design that serves its purpose expresses beauty.
